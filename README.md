# AbaloneMachineLearningProject
Created a machine learning project that predicts the age of abalone given parameters such as the width, weight, sex, and other descriptions of the snails.

This is one of my first truly independent machine learning projects.

Here is the workflow of what I accomplished:

1. I gathered the abalone data set and converted it to a DataFrame using pandas.
2. Next, I explored the data using EDA techniques.
3. I used a feature engineering technique to effectively deal with the categorical variable in the data set.
4. I displayed statistical relationships using seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot and even created a heatmap.
5. Then, I trained and evaluated two different machine learning models. The first model was a linear regression while the second was a random forest regressor.
6. Afterwards, I plotted evaluation charts including residuals, scatter plots, and distributions to compare the two models.

Overall, here is a summary of the skills I learned and implemented:
- EDA workflow
- Dealing with categorical variables and feature engineering
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning algorithms for regression problems
- Using different metrics to evaluate how accurate a regression model is
